Major U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase is allowing its wealth management clients to invest in a selection of crypto funds, including Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) according to reports

The bank, which has been making a significant push to grow its $630 billion wealth-management business, told advisors in a memo earlier this week that they can now take orders to buy and sell five cryptocurrency products, four from Grayscale Investments and one from Osprey Funds, effective July 19, according to *Business Insider.* 

Grayscale is the biggest asset manager in the crypto world currently [managing](https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1417952608527032332) $27.5 billion. It is owned by Digital Currency Group, a New York City-based venture capital firm. But as of late, the firm’s shares have been trading at a discount to the price of Bitcoin. 

The move follows a report that a large number of JPMorgan clients see cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), as an asset class, including those plugged into the commission-free Chase trading app with easy access to indirect crypto investing. Trust products from Grayscale and Osprey are “price exposure” vehicles that sidestep custody headaches. 

*Business Insider* added that JPMorgan's advisors can execute only "unsolicited" crypto trades, meaning advisors cannot recommend the products but are allowed to buy or sell on the behalf of a client's request.

In March, the bank said it had designed a new debt instrument that provides investors direct exposure to a basket of crypto-focused companies, including business intelligence firm MicroStrategy. In addition, the company recently posted that it would be hiring for positions focusing on blockchain technology, including software developers, engineers, and auditors.

In 2017, the company’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, previously [called](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-raises-flag-on-trading-revenue-sees-20-percent-fall-for-the-third-quarter.html) Bitcoin a “fraud” and threatened to fire employees who traded bitcoin. However, recent reports have suggested that the company is allowing its clients more exposure to space and is adopting blockchain solutions.
