Alabama and New Jersey took action against BlockFi earlier this week, alleging securities laws violations.

State regulators have filed for a cease-and-desist against BlockFi and two of its subsidiaries, BlockFi Lending and BlockFi Trading, over an alleged sale of unregistered securities.

New Jersey was the first state to go after BlockFi for its alleged dealings in unregistered securities, filing a cease-and-desist earlier this week. Just yesterday, Alabama regulators hit the company with a show-cause notice essentially a threat, asking BlockFi to defend itself against a potential cease-and-desist

Texas said it notified BlockFi in late April that its lending product might be violating state securities rules. The lender continued to illegally offer BIA(BlockFi Interest Account ) in Texas, according to The Texas State Securities Board (TSSB).

“The BIAs constitute investment contracts, notes, or evidences of indebtedness regulated as securities as that term is defined by Section 4.A of the Securities Act,” the filing said.

But the company  tweeted that: "the BlockFi Interest Account is not a security." Our stance hasn't changed - the BlockFI Interest Account is not a security.

The cease-and-desist hasn’t taken effect, and won’t unless a judge signs off after a hearing in October, the filing gives the company a chance to formally respond to the allegations. The company is allowed to continue operations until the hearing.
