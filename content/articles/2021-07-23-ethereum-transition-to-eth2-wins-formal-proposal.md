A formal Ethereum Improvement Proposal has been created for the network’s forthcoming chain merge, bringing Ethereum one step closer to realizing its highly anticipated Proof-of-Stake transition.

ConsenSys researcher Mikhail Kalinin created a pull-request for EIP-3675 on Github, formalizing the chain merge as an improvement proposal for the first time.

The merge would upgrade the blockchain's consensus mechanism to [proof of stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/), a system that allows people to validate transactions and create new blocks based on how much ETH they contribute.

The Ethereum Improvement Proposal which sets for the merge would be discussed during the July 23 Ethereum Core Devs Meeting by developer Tim Beiko.

According to Tim Beiko,  it is very unlikely the chain merge will occur during 2021 but everything would have to go perfectly.

The intent of Ethereum 2.0 is to allow more and speedier transactions on the network. The blockchain has often struggled with congestion, as it's not able to process any more than about 15 transactions per second. 

Since the launch of the beacon chain in December, Eth2 has emerged as the second-largest PoS network by staked capitalization in USD terms, with $12.7 billion worth of Ether locked in staking despite less than 6% of its circulating supply having been deposited.
