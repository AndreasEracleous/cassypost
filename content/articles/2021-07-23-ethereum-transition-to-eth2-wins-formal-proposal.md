According to The Guardian, user information including IP addresses, email addresses, and passwords was accessed through a poor security configuration on the project’s website.

The identities of 1,000 new users signing up to a website associated with a Donald Trump cryptocurrency "magacoin" have been exposed.

A hacker was able to breach the websites’ security where they exposed the email addresses, passwords, cryptocurrency wallet addresses, and IP addresses of users who bought Magacoin.

The data also reveals that the lion’s share of the cryptocurrency so far produced has been allocated to the self-described creator of magacoin, a pro-Trump consultant who owns an LLC associated with the cryptocurrency, and a Super Pac associated with the same consultant.

An unnamed and self-described hacktivist told The Guardian that more than 1,000 people have signed up, including Republican figures and conservative media personalities, with the majority of hodlers having around 100 MAGACOIN.

The project’s creator used car salesman Marc Zelinka, reportedly holds 2 million MAGACOIN, along with Reilly O’Neal, a pro-Trump consultant who is now operating the project.

One account compromised is linked to the email address of conservative broadcaster John Rush, while another is associated with a Colorado Republican Party youth engagement affiliate, according to the report.

Another Tidewater email address is associated with holdings of just over 2m magacoins. His political consultancy, [Tidewater Strategies](https://twitter.com/tidewaterstrat?lang=en), received large sums from mostly Trumpist Republican candidates in the last election cycle, many of whom failed to win office.

A super political action community (SuperPAC) is also tied to the project and called “MAGACOIN VICTORY FUND”, which has received a 10 million MAGACOIN donation to support “MAGA candidates across the country who will fight for individual rights, religious liberty, protecting the unborn, the 2nd amendment, freedom of speech and the entire America First Agenda.”

The SuperPAC’s mailing address is reportedly located at the same place several other firms and political groups operated by O’Neal.

O’Neal also reportedly has a stake in the far-right conspiracy-minded website Big League Politics (BLP) through another of his companies, Mustard Seed Media.
